# RetroActivity

RetroActivity is the time tracking app for unorganized and effective people. Never forget to press that tracking button - RetroActivity allows you to organize your tasks after you've worked on them. And never forget how long you've worked on a task - RetroActivity will remind you when and how long you worked using which program.
